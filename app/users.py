    "aboutme": "I'm a Computer Engineering student who's very passionate about Robotics and AI both in a personal and professional avenue. As a result I'm starting to look deeper into topics like Machine Learning, Autonomous Vehicles and Humanoid Robotics. Currently I'm starting to focus on growing my skills in C++, Python, Operating Systems and Data Structures and Algorithms. I have a background in IT, which led to me gaining interest in Cloud Computing as well. On my personal interests, I absolutely love hackathons, they are great way to meet others and to explore new topics and push boundaries. As a result of them, I've started to become interested in joining both Kaggle Competitions and Robotics Tournaments."

Pictured to the right is a photo I took while on a hike in the Grand Canyon. Most of the hiking I do isn't as crazy as that, although my trip was a good memory. Generally just going walking among grassy and slightly rocky fields is my go to!", "I find studying languages to be very fascinating. There have been many studies done on the effects on language, and the results are very interesting. To study language is to quite literally change your brain and perspective. Well benefits aside, I simply enjoy taking on different systems of writing/speaking and thought. I'm currently studying Japanese, and so far it's been quite a journey. Kanji is definitely no joke!"],
